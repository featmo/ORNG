Basic Heads up display built using electron

A small small design oriented javascript project I worked on to get my head around javascript, electron, and nodejs.
I used [openweathermap's](https://openweathermap.org/api) api for fetching the weather data, just open up getInfo.js
and make all the changes you want.
